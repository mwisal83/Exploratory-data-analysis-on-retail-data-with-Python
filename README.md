# Exploratory-data-analysis-on-retail-data-with-Python
In this project, we use transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases.  We conducted exploratory data analysis, to identify patterns, outliers, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.
