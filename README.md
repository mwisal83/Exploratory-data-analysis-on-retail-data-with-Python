# Exploratory-data-analysis-on-retail-data-with-Python
In this project, we use transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases. Our task was to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. We conducted exploratory data analysis, to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction.
